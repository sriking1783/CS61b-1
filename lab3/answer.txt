Based on what I saw through the debugger as well as what I read up online about autoboxing of Integers in java, I believe that the error in Flik.java arises because of a restriction in the valueOf() method used in autoboxing. Since the static Integer.valueOf() method caches integer objects, the == operator in the isSameNumber() method will evaluate to false when i = 128 and j = 128. This is because the valueOf() method will always look at values in the range between -128 and 127, so any integer outside this range will be cached. Since the == operator only checks reference points instead of the actual value of the integer, it will return false and so the loop breaks and the code terminates earlier than expected.
